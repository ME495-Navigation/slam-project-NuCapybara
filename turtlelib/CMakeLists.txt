# Find your dependencies.
# Many libraries ship with files that allow CMake to find them
# Then general behavior is to call "find_package" but the options
# provided are package specific.  Usually there is then a CMAKE variable
# That is defined to reference the library
# here: we find the eigen library as per the instruction
# https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/TopicCMakeGuide.html
# find_package(Eigen3 3.3 REQUIRED)

# Create a library.  Can specify if it is shared or static but usually
# you don't need or want to.
# name is the name of the library without the extension or lib prefix
# name creates a cmake "target"
