<!-- Save me as a .svg file and open in inkscape to view -->
<!-- Set the page side to 8.5inches by 11 inches.

     The viewBox sets the conversion from pixels to inches and is
     the frame in which you draw.

     The viewBox frame, in this case has:
       96 pixels per inch (a line 96 pixels long is one inch long).
       The origin is in the upper-left corner of the page.
       The x pixel value increases to the right.
       The y pixel value increases down.
       (This is a left-handed coordinate system).

     When drawing, we will conceive of the image as follows:
       1 unit in turtlelib (e.g., meters) corresponds to 1 inch in the svg.

       The "fixed frame" is implicitly the midpoint of the page (in viewBox coordinates),
       with x axis positive to the right and y axis positive up.

       Therefore coordinate frame resulting from the identity transform
       is drawn at the center of the page with axis right and y axis up.

     The opening <svg> tag can be literally included in the file you produce.

<!-- Below there is one tag for each item you wish to draw -->

<!-- The circle tag is used for drawing a point.
     The only attributes you need to change are:
     cx - The x coordinate of the circle's center in the viewBox frame.
     cy - The y coordinate of the circle's center in the viewBox frame.
     stroke - The color of the outline of the circle.
     fill - the color of the fill of the circle.

     For a point, the stroke and fill color can be the same.
     Color can be specified in several ways in SVG but
     it is sufficient for you to use string names of common colors
     (e.g., "red", "green", "orange", etc.).
-->
<circle cx="500" cy="500" r="3" stroke="purple" fill="purple" stroke-width="1" />

<!-- This line tag draws a vector.
     The only attributes you need to change are:
     x1 - The head's x coordinate in the viewBox frame.
     y1 - The head's y coordinate in the viewBox frame.
     x2 - The tail's x coordinate in the viewBox frame.
     y2 - The tail's y coordinate in the viewBox frame.
     stroke - The color of the vector.

<!-- The <g> tag groups objects together.
     This tag makes a coordinate frame.
     A coordinate frame {a} is drawn with two vectors:
     1. A red "x" vector. It is (1, 0) in frame {a} coordinates
     2. A green "y" vector. It is (0, 1) in frame {b} coordinates
     3. Text (slightly offset from the origin) (via the <text> tag)
        x - the x coordinate of the text in the viewBox frame
        y - the y coordinate of the text in the viewBox frame
        The body of the <text> tag contains the text to display
